But it is tedious to write a model with 20 epochs, run it, see loss was decreasing, then repeat that with 40 epochs, etc.  Worse, if we change the model or it's parameters, like adjusting the dropout percentage, the number of epochs required to see when the loss stops decreasing might be different.\n",
